Pynq2.7 image for Zedboard

Not saying that it is not out there, but I was unable to find a working ready-to-run Pynq2.7 image for the Zedboard.
Admitted, it was not a walk in the park but eventually I was able to succesfully generate such image.

Instruction on how to compile are not yet included...
Meanwhile, please feel free to download and use my try at PYNQ2.7 for Zedboard.
